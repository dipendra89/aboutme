            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>My name is Dipendra. I was born and raised in a tiny South Asian country, Nepal till high school. 
                I went to a college near Houston, called Sam Houston State University and also took few other classes here and there in different schools.
                I had an opportunity to be part of the great military, US Army which was fun even though some of you might not agree with me. 
                Oh yeah, I did work in Post Office part-time while I was going to college. Currently, I am working full time as a Database Administrator.
                The reason I joined this course is pretty much same as everyone else's, I wanted to gain knowledge on programming. 
                My long term goal is to learn and be a good Software Developer and change the world. Wish me luck. Please. 
                My page is so short so, let me talk little more then. I would love to see how the page would look like on mobile devices. 
                I am not sure if I am supposed to do anything. I do not know. I am just a rookie here. Oh yeah, people asked me why the heck did you move to 
                Seattle from Colorado because Colorado is beautiful. First of all, I do listen to people but make my own decision. Second of all, 
                Seattle has its own thing here I heard. Anyway, I am excited to get the new experience in a new city. I kind of like the ocean if you call it ocean.
