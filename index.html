            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>My name is Dipendra. I was born and raised in a tiny South Asian country, Nepal till high school. I went to a college near Houston, called Sam Houston State University and also took few other classes here and there in different schools. <br>
            I had an opportunity to be part of the great military, US Army which was fun even though some of you might not agree with me. Oh yeah, I did work in Post Office part-time while I was going to college. Currently, I am working full time as a Database Administrator. <br>
            The reason I joined this course is pretty much same as everyone else's, I wanted to gain knowledge on programming. My long term goal is to learn and be a good Software Developer and change the world. Wish me luck. Please.
            </p>
